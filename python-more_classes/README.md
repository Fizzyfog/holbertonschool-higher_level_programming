# Python: Deep Dive into Classes and Objects

This repository is dedicated to exploring the concepts of Classes and Objects in Python, and why they make Python programming so awesome!

## Objectives

This course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of:

1. The concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and why it's important.
2. The definition and usage of classes, objects, and instances.
3. The difference between a class and an object or instance.
4. The role of attributes in Python and how to use public, protected, and private attributes.
5. The purpose of the `self` keyword.
6. The definition and usage of methods, including the special `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__repr__` methods.
7. The concepts of Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding.
8. The role of properties in Python and the difference between an attribute and a property.
9. The Pythonic way to write getters and setters.
10. The difference between `__str__` and `__repr__`.
11. The concept of class attributes and the difference between object attributes and class attributes.
12. The definition and usage of class methods and static methods.
13. How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class.
14. How to bind attributes to objects and classes.
15. The role of `__dict__` in a class and an instance of a class.
16. How Python finds the attributes of an object or class.
17. How to use the `getattr` function.

By the end of this course, you should have a solid understanding of these concepts and be able to apply them in your Python programming journey.
