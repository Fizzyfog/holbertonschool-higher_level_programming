# Python - Test-Driven Development

This project focuses on the importance of test-driven development in Python programming. It covers the creation of interactive tests, writing docstrings for tests, and finding edge cases.

## Why Python Programming is Awesome

Python is a versatile, high-level programming language that is easy to learn and use. It supports multiple programming paradigms and has a large standard library.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the importance of tests in programming
- Learn how to write docstrings to create tests
- Learn how to write documentation for each module and function
- Understand the basic option flags to create tests
- Learn how to find edge cases

## Project Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Code should adhere to the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files should end with a new line
- All test files should be inside a folder named `tests`
- All test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- Tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__')`)
- All functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__')`)
